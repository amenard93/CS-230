# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The client The Gaming Room is developing a game called Draw It or Lose It where a picture is loaded at a set pace and it is up to the team to guess what the picture is before the time is up. It utilizes a database of drawings to randomly pull from. One of the main requirements from the client is that the game is available across multiple platforms. The software requirements are as follows:
- A game will have the ability to have one or more teams involved.
- Each team will have multiple players assigned to it.
- Game and team names must be unique to allow users to check whether a name is in use when choosing a team name.
- Only one instance of the game can exist in memory at any given time. This can be accomplished by creating unique identifiers for each instance of a game, team, or player.
# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I felt I did well finalizng the UML Diagram for this project. I also did well the recommendations and explanations of why. 
# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Working through the design document helped to lay out the process in steps and to organize thoughts. It was helpful in breaking down the differnet aspects of the application and what was important to be considering throughout the design. 
# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would revise the evaluations. I could compare min more detail the comparisons between operating systems and how the design of the program would be effected by which OS is used. I would also add evaluation to Security and user file access controls. 
# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
It is important to understand what is important to the client in how the game will work, feel, and look across platforms. I make sure to look at the end product from developers point of view, and an end-users point of view. Putting myself in the shoes of the client and the user provides insight into what they want out of the end product and how we can achieve that while staying within the clients requirements (budget, features, abilities, functionality).
# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approached it by using a consultative approach and making sure to get the information that I need to fully understand the needs of the client. Putting yourself in the perspective of the client and the user so that you can see the end product from all angles is very important as well. In the future, I would also try to cross collaborate with workers from departments that I am not familiar or an expert in (such as finance, legal, HR, etc..). This waywe can be sure to provide an end product that covers all of the bases.
